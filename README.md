🌱 Air Quality Monitoring System Using Arduino Uno
📌 Project Description

This project presents an Air Quality Monitoring System using Arduino Uno that measures air quality, temperature, and humidity in real time. The system uses an MQ-135 gas sensor to monitor air pollution levels, a DHT sensor to measure ambient temperature and humidity, and an OLED display with I²C interface to visually display the measured parameters.

The project is designed as a beginner-friendly embedded systems and environmental monitoring application, suitable for academic mini projects, Arduino learners, and basic IoT system foundations.
